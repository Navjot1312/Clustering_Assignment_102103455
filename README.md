# Clustering_Assignment_102103455

In this assignment we had to perform different clustering algorithms using different pre-processing techniques with different numbers of clusters on different evaluation parameters.

I have used Pycaret in this assignment.

The dataset that I have used is Iris Dataset.

The three clustering techniques I have used are:
1. K means Clustering
2. Hierarchical Clustering
3. DBSCAN

The Parameters I have taken are:
1. Silhouette
2. Calinski-Harabasz
3. Davies-Bouldin

The Pre-Processing techniques I have used are:
1. Normalization
2. PCA (Principle Component Analysis)
3. Transform
4. Scale

The absence of a 'scale' column in the DBSCAN results is because DBSCAN does not utilize distance-based similarity metrics in the same manner as KMeans or hierarchical clustering algorithms, hence it is not as directly influenced by scaling.
